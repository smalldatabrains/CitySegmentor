# Rust Detection CNN Classifier

A deep learning application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect rust in images. The project includes both a training module and a user-friendly GUI application for making predictions.

## Features

- CNN model built with PyTorch
- Training on the Corrosion_Rust dataset
- Real-time predictions through a drag-and-drop interface
- Model checkpoint saving and loading
- Confidence scores for predictions

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

- `classifier.py`: CNN model definition and training code
- `predict_app.py`: GUI application for making predictions
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies
- `best_model.pth`: Trained model checkpoint (created after training)

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python classifier.py
   ```
2. The best model will be automatically saved as `best_model.pth`

### Making Predictions

1. Run the prediction application:
   ```bash
   python predict_app.py
   ```
2. Drag and drop any image onto the application window
3. The prediction result and confidence score will be displayed

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:
- 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling
- Fully connected layers with dropout for regularization
- Output layer for binary classification (Rust/No Rust)

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Corrosion_Rust dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BinKhoaLe1812/Corrosion_Rust) from Hugging Face, which contains images of rusted and non-rusted surfaces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PIL (Pillow)
- tkinterdnd2
- datasets (Hugging Face)
Â²
## Future Work

segmentation instead of labelling
